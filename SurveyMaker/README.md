Description of gruepr-SurveyMaker:

        Gruepr is a program for splitting a section of 4-200 students into optimized teams.
        
        SurveyMaker is a secondary app used to easily create and use a customized Google Form to collect the
        student data used by gruepr. After selecting the desired options in SurveyMaker and hitting the "Create
        Survey" button, a browser window opens to run the Google script and show additional information. Once
        complete, the user has two new files on the Google Drive: the Google Form itself and a spreadsheet that
        will contain the students' responses.
