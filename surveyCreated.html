These response values should be edited so that students know how to respond.
         You can include any text you like in the responses, and you may include as many response options as you like. If the options have a natural order, as with a Likert-scale response, include a corresponding number at the beginning of each reponse (e.g., "1. Yes  /  2. Maybe  /  3. No").</li>
      <? } ?>
      <? if (sections && noSectionNames) { ?>
        <li>You have added a question asking students in which class section they are enrolled, however no response options were given.
         Multiple-choice response values must be added so that students know how to respond.</li>
      <? } ?>
      <? if (includeAdditional) { ?>
        <li>You indicated that you wanted additional questions at the end of the survey.
         Currently, a single, placeholder question has been added ("Any additional things we should know about you before we form the teams?").
         This question can be removed or modified in any way, and any number and type of additional questions can be added to the end of the survey.</li>

    <li>You can modify the survey title.</li>
    <li>You can edit the instructions shown in the first section of the survey.</li>
    <li>You can add "description text" to any of the other sections of the survey and/or any of the questions.</li>
    <? if (sections && !noSectionNames) { ?>
      <li>You can edit the section names, including adding additional section names or removing existing ones.</li>

    <? if (gender) { ?>
      <li>You can reword the gender question, but you should leave the word "gender" or "pronoun" somewhere in the question text. gruepr will auto-recognize a number of responses to this question: woman, girl, female, she-her, man, boy, male, he-him, nonbinary, queer, and they-them.</li>
    <? } ?>
    <? if (urm) { ?>
      <li>You can reword the race/ethnicity question, but you should leave the word "ethnic" or "ethnicity" somewhere in the question text.</li>

    <li><b><u>Do NOT delete, reword, or reorder any of the other questions.</u></b></li>
    </ul>
    <br><hr><br>
    <br>Two files have been created: the Google Forms survey, and a Google Sheets spreadsheet that will hold the responses. You can view and/or edit these files in your Google Drive, though editing the spreadsheet is not recommended.
    <br><br>For your convenience, the following URLs have been created. For later use, you should copy-and-paste these addresses into a text file or other saved location. When you are done, you can close this window.
    <br>
    <br>You can edit the survey at:
    <br><H4>[ <a href = "<?= editURL ?>" target="_blank"><?= editURL ?></a> ].</H4>
    <br>Students fill out the survey at:<br><H4>[ <a href = "<?= shortURL ?>" target="_blank"><?= shortURL ?></a> ].</H4>
    <br>After all responses have been collected, you can download the survey results file used by gruepr at:<br><H4>[ <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<?= ssID ?>/export?format=csv" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<?= ssID ?>/export?format=csv</a> ].</H4>
