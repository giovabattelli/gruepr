<h3>About gruepr</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Gruepr is a program for splitting a section of 4-300 students into optimized teams. It is originally based on CATME's team forming routine as described in <a href="http://advances.asee.org/wp-content/uploads/vol02/issue01/papers/aee-vol02-issue01-p09.pdf">this paper</a>. All the student data is read from a file, and the students are split into teams of any desired size(s).</p>
<h3>Obtaining student data</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A Google Form is generally used to collect data from the students. You can copy a model Google Form into your own Google Drive by <a href="http://bit.ly/TeamFormSurv">clicking here</a>, or you can use gruepr's SurveyMaker to create your own form. After collecting responses, go to the Google Form and, in the "Responses" tab, click the three-dot icon and select "Download responses (.csv)".</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The model Google Form can be edited so that you collect data relevant to your needs. The gender and/or URM questions can be removed, if desired. The attribute questions are optional and completely customizable. Found on Section 3 of the form, they can be modified, reordered, added to, or removed. There can be from 0 to 9 of these attribute questions. The schedule section can be removed, or the numbers and names of the days and times can be altered. The only requirement here is to have 7 or fewer days and 24 or fewer hours in the matrix. The Form can optionally include a question asking students which course section they are in so that multiple sections can all use the same form. Additional questions of any number or kind for your own use can be added to the end of the form.</p>
<h3>How the teams are optimized and displayed</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A good distribution of students into teams is determined by a numerical score. The score can be based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing isolated women, isolated men, isolated non-binary persons, and/or single-gender teams;</li>
<li>Preventing isolated URM students</li>
<li>Achieving within each team either homogeneity or heterogeneity of up to 9 "attributes", which could be skills assessments, work preferences, attitudes, major, GPA, or any other categorical/Likert question</li>
<li>Preventing students with incompatible attributes from being on the same team
<li>Achieving a high degree of overlap in schedule free time (with timezone awareness)</li>
<li>Preventing any particular students from being on the same team</li>
<li>Requiring any particular students to be on the same team</li>
<li>Requiring at least a certain number of students from a particular list to be on the same team</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;After optimizing the teams for some time, the best set of teams found is shown on the screen. The teams are displayed showing the students names, emails, indications of gender and/or URM status (if those data are included), and each student's attribute levels. Each team's score is also shown along with a table of student availability at each time slot throughout the week. You can choose whether to save this teamset, adjust this teamset by moving around individual students or teams, or throw away the teamset entirely and start over. If you save the teamset, three files can be printed or saved as text or pdf files: 1) the full output including demographic data on each student; 2) the same screen output but without listing any of the team scores or student attributes, which is useful for distributing to the students; and 3) the section, team, and student info in a spreadsheet format.</p>

<h3>Further details on the optimization algorithm</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To optimize the teams, a genetic algorithm is used. First, a large population of 30,000 random teamings (each is a "genome") is created and then refined over multiple generations. In each generation, a few of the highest scoring "elite" genomes are directly copied (cloned) into the next generation, and then the vast majority are created by mating tournament-selected parent genomes using ordered crossover. Once the next generation's genepool is created, each genome has 1 or more potential mutations, which is a swapping of two random locations on the genome. A genome's net score is the harmonic mean of the score for each team. Harmonic mean is used so that low scoring teams have more weight. Evolution proceeds for at least minGenerations and at most maxGenerations, displaying generation number and the score of that generation's best genome. Evolution stops (user can choose to keep it going) when the best score has remained +/- 1% for generationsOfStability generations or when maxGenerations is reached.</p>

<h3>Further details on the data file format</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The datafile of student information has a specific required format. Using the Google Form allows you to download the data into exactly this file format without modification. The datafile must be a comma-separated-values (.csv) file with these contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>a header row that contains the question texts, with specific wording needed in some of the questions if you want gruepr to auto-recognize the question type</li>
<li>each student on a separate row, starting at the row immediately after the header; comma-separated values within each row are:</li>
<ul>
<li>timestamp</li>
<li>first name or preferred name</li>
<li>last name</li>
<li>[optional] email</li>
<li>[optional] "Woman", "Man", "Nonbinary", and any number of additional gender categories ("Prefer not to say", etc.)</li>
<li>[optional] student's self-identified racial / ethnic / cultural identity</li>
<li>[0 to 15 values] text responses to "attribute" questions, each in own field</li>
<li>[0 to 7 values] semicolon-separated list of times within each day that the student is either available or unavailable to work</li>
<li>[optional] section</li>
<li>[optional] any additional notes for the student (additional columns can be included and left ignored by gruepr)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
