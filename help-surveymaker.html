<h3>gruepr: SurveyMaker</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;gruepr: SurveyMaker is used to create a Google Form that has been customized to collect the data you want to use in forming optimal teams with gruepr. First, in the box near the top-left enter a title for your form (e.g., "English Composition Team Survey, Spring 2021"). Next, choose which questions you would like to include in your survey using the checkmarks down the left side. Several of these questions have further options that can/should be customized. As each of the survey options is modified, the preview shown on the right side will be updated. When the survey options have all been set, click the green button near the top of the window to create the Google Form. The Form will be created and saved in your Google Drive (your data is private--no data about or from your survey is <b>ever</b> sent to gruepr's creators or anyone else). If the creation process is succesful, your browser window will open with final instructions on how best to use the survey you have created.
